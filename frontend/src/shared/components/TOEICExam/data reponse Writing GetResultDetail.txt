                "answerText": "My hometown is a city small in the south coast of the country, where I live since I am born. It's a very peaceful place, which is why I love it much. The city have many old, beautiful buildings from the colonial time, and near the center is a big park where people do morning exercise. The best feature is the long beach, where you can see the perfect sunset every day. Most of people work in the fish market or for the tourism industry, like hotels and small guest house. Traffic is not good because many motorbikes always go very fast and ignore the red light. The food is the best I think! There are many restaurant where you can buy fresh sea food for cheap price, especialy the grilled fish. I like my hometown very much, even if it is slow sometime and there are not many new job. It is a good place for relax and not stress like a big city, and I hope to live here for all my life. The weather is always hot, which I prefer, and the people is very friend and always smile to everyone they meet in the street. I am very proud of my little town history and its lovely nature.",

Many agents are unhappy with the system, and it makes our work very difficult and slow when we have big rush hour with many guest.\n\nHere is the list of THREE problem with the reservation system that I see every day:\n\n1. System Freeze Often: The computer system for booking always freeze and crash very often when I try to process group check-in for more than ten people, especialy when I try to process all the credit card at once. This freezing make long queue very much in the lobby and guest become angry, which is bad for the hotel reputation.\n\n2. Credit Card Processing Slow: The machine to take payment with card is extremely slow, it take at least three minute for one person to finalize the transaction, sometimes it fails and I have to retry many time. This is not efficient at all and makes me worry about the payment being collected correctly from all guests.\n\n3. Guest Profile Mix-up: Sometimes the system show the wrong guest profile for the room they book, or it erase their special request, like extra towel or non-smoking room on the high floor. Once, a guest was given a room with two beds when she requested one big bed, and she was furious. The system needs to be more stable so the information is correct and not lost, it is causing big trouble for our service.\n\nI hope these information help you fix the bad problem soon and the IT department can work on this issue very fast.\n\nSincerely,\nA Front Desk Agent",

Many agents are unhappy with the system, and it makes our work very difficult and slow when we have big rush hour with many guests.\n\nHere is the list of THREE problems with the reservation system that I see every day:\n\n1. System Freezes Often: The computer system for booking always freezes and crashes very often when I try to process group check-in for more than ten people, especially when I try to process all the credit cards at once. This freezing creates very long queues in the lobby and guests become angry, which is bad for the hotel reputation.\n\n2. Credit Card Processing Slow: The machine to take payment with a card is extremely slow. It takes at least three minutes for one person to finalize the transaction; sometimes it fails and I have to retry many times. This is not efficient at all and makes me worry about the payment being collected correctly from all guests.\n\n3. Guest Profile Mix-up: Sometimes the system shows the wrong guest profile for the room they booked, or it erases their special requests, like extra towels or a non-smoking room on a high floor. Once, a guest was given a room with two beds when she requested one big bed, and she was furious. The system needs to be more stable so the information is correct and not lost; it is causing big trouble for our service.\n\nI hope this information helps you fix the bad problems soon and the IT department can work on this issue very fast.\n\nSincerely,\nA Front Desk Agent",

                "answerText": "Many people all over the world enjoy sport very much, no matter if they are playing on a field or watching on the TV in their home. They spend a lot of time and money on this activity, and I think that sports are very important to all peoples for three important thing in life. These important things is health physical, learning life lessons, and building a strong friendship and community feeling. People need to know why sports are great to have good and happy life because the benefits are more than just a game.\n\nFirst thing is that sports is good for health physical and mental well-being. If you always sitting at your desk and not move, you will become fat and maybe sick many time, especialy with problem like high blood pressure or diabetes, which is common in today's world. Sport activity is like running, playing soccer or basketball, or even just going to gym. These exercise make your body strong and your heart work better, and they also help you to sleep better at night. For example, my brother play tennis every week, and he is never sick and always feel positive and full of energy, he is happy and his mind is clear. This is important for health for long time and for living quality life.\n\nSecond, sports teach you lessons life what is important for you later when you are an adult in your work life. You learn for cooperate with all your team members, even if you don't like they very much as a person, because you must work together to win. If you don't cooperate, you lose the game, which teach the important of teamwork. Also, when the game is very difficult and you feel bad and want to cry, you must not give up the fighting. This skill is call perseverance, and I use this skill every day at my work when my project is hard and I think I cannot finish it. The sport make me know how to work with group and not quit easy when something is challenging.\n\nFinally, many people like to watch sport because it make many friend and a feeling of belonging. When my country team play in the international game, all people go to same bar or pub and shout very loud for the team. We don't know other person, but we are friend that night because we share the same passion and the same hope for victory. This make community very much strong and people feel happy together, which is important for mental health. The feeling of belong is important for everyone life to not feel lonely.\n\nFor these reasons, I think sport is super important to people life. It make our body good, teach us good thing for our career, and give us friend time always and a strong community feeling, making life more fulfilled and healthy for all.",
