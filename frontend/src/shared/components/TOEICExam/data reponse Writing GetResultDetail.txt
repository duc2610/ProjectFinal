These exercise make your body strong and your heart work better. For example, my brother play tennis every week, and he is never sick. This is important for health for long time.\n\nSecond, sports teach you lessons life what is important for you later. You learn for cooperate with all your team members, even if you don't like they. If you don't cooperate, you lose the game. Also, when the game is difficult and you feel bad, you must not give up. This is call perseverance. I use this skill at work when my project is hard. The sport make me know how to work with group and not quit easy.\n\nFinally, many people like to watch sport because it make many friend. When my country team play, all people go to same bar and shout. We don't know other person, but we are friend that night. This make community very much strong and people feel happy together. The feeling of belong is important for everyone life.\n\nFor these reasons, I think sport is super important to people life.

                "correctedText": "Many people enjoy sports very much. They spend time watching or playing; both are popular. I think that sports are very important to all people for three important things. These things are health, learning, and friendship. People need to know why sports are great to have a good life.\n\nFirst, sports are good for physical health. If you are always sitting and not moving, you will become fat and maybe sick many times. Sport activities are like running or playing soccer or basketball. These exercises make your body strong and your heart work better. For example, my brother plays tennis every week, and he is never sick. This is important for health for a long time.\n\nSecond, sports teach you life lessons that are important for you later. You learn to cooperate with all your team members, even if you don't like them. If you don't cooperate, you lose the game. Also, when the game is difficult and you feel bad, you must not give up. This is called perseverance. I use this skill at work when my project is hard. Sports make me know how to work with a group and not quit easily.\n\nFinally, many people like to watch sports because it makes many friends. When my country's team plays, all people go to the same bar and shout. We don't know other people, but we are friends that night. This makes community very strong and people feel happy together. The feeling of belonging is important for everyone's life.\n\nFor these reasons, I think sports are super important to people's lives. They make our body good, teach us good things, and always give us time with friends.",
